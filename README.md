# IBM UrbanCode Build Plugin Template
---

The IBM UrbanCode Build Plugin Template demonstrates a Gradle integration for a community plug-in. This is a sample project that can be forked and used as a base for all community plug-ins.

When creating your own plug-in, you will want to change all of the files in src/main/zip/info.xml and src/main/zip/plugin.xml. Documentation
for our plug-ins can be found in the [IBM UrbanCode Build Help Center](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8NMD_6.1.2/com.ibm.ucbuild.doc/topics/c_node_extend.html).

### Compiling Source
`gradle`

The Gradle plug-in .zip file can be found in build/distributions once the project has been built.
